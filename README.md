# Front-End Developer Challenge

## About
This repo contains a tool for a fictitious game called “TitanStar Legends”, made as a front-end coding challenge.

The app setup was based on Vite-React template with TypeScript, and was written using node in version 18.17.1.

## Approaches
The application has implemented all requirements defined in the challenge.
The application utilizes feature-based approach for file structure (single hermetic feature).
The state management is handled by the `useReducer` hook.
Styling made using `SCSS`, with usage of `minireset.css` library for resetting styles.

## Tasks
1. Run `npm install` script in your terminal.
2. Next, run `npm run dev` to run the application in development mode.
3. Et voila - application  should be running on `http://localhost:5173/` :)

...unless you're using `yarn`, then run `yarn` and `yarn dev` in sequence.
